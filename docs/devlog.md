### Session: Auth, Navigation, and Theming

**What was done:**
- Implemented Supabase authentication (login, signup, forgot password)
- Created auth store with Svelte 5 runes pattern
- Built responsive navigation:
  - BottomNav for mobile
  - SideNav for desktop
  - AppShell wrapper component
- Implemented dynamic theming system:
  - 8 color schemes (Emerald, Blue, Cyan, Indigo, Orange, Slate, Red, Pink)
  - CSS custom properties for instant theme switching
  - localStorage persistence
  - ThemeSelector component in Settings
- Created main app pages: Home, Blocks, Exercises, Settings
- Set up database types and Supabase client

**Technical decisions:**
- Using CSS variables (`var(--color-*)`) for theming instead of Tailwind classes for instant switching
- Auth store uses getter pattern to expose reactive state from Svelte 5 runes
- Route protection via `$effect()` redirects

**Notes:**
- Supabase migrations run directly in dashboard (not via CLI)
- Theme persists across sessions via localStorage

### Session: Project Setup & Documentation Structure

**What was done:**
- Created CLAUDE.md for Claude Code guidance
- Set up documentation structure:
  - `docs/` - troubleshooting, decisions, devlog
  - `specs/` - moved PRD, app flow, and design docs
- Initial SvelteKit + Tailwind + Supabase setup was already complete

**Notes:**
- Project uses Svelte 5 runes syntax (`$props()`, `$state()`, etc.)
- Tailwind v4 uses simplified import: `@import 'tailwindcss'`
- Supabase client installed but not yet configured in app code

**Next steps:**
- Set up Supabase client configuration
- Implement authentication flow
- Build out initial route structure
