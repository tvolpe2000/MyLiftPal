### Session: Project Setup & Documentation Structure

**What was done:**
- Created CLAUDE.md for Claude Code guidance
- Set up documentation structure:
  - `docs/` - troubleshooting, decisions, devlog
  - `specs/` - moved PRD, app flow, and design docs
- Initial SvelteKit + Tailwind + Supabase setup was already complete

**Notes:**
- Project uses Svelte 5 runes syntax (`$props()`, `$state()`, etc.)
- Tailwind v4 uses simplified import: `@import 'tailwindcss'`
- Supabase client installed but not yet configured in app code

**Next steps:**
- Set up Supabase client configuration
- Implement authentication flow
- Build out initial route structure
